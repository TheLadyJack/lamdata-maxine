Import pandas as pd in my_mod.py
X is undefined in my_mod.py dt_list
    I'm guessing you want it to be a new dataframe with 3 columns?
Combine all 3 return statements into 1, otherwise won't work. 
    ex: return (X['Year'], X['Month'], X['Day'])

ReadMe should describe what the functions do.

Code is readable, and easy to understand and follow. Great job! This is the hardest part!
